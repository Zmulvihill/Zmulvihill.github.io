Here are some of the projects I have worked on in freecodecamp and developing my skills in html, css.styles and javascript.

## Survey Form

</p>

* <u>About</u>: This was my first html and css.styles project in freecodecamp and showed me the ropes for both. This project opened the door for me learning html and css.styles and showed me how I can personalize something as simple as a survey and add my own touches to it.

* <u>About</u>: This is my Tribute Page project from freecodecamp. Here I shared my love and enjoyment for Calvin and Hobbes and made a tribute to the author of Calvin and Hobbes, Bill Watterson. This gave me an opportunity to further my skills in html and css.styles while showing my appreciation for a comic that I've grown up with.

* Site: [https://jjwall.github.io/BoardhouseTS/](https://jjwall.github.io/BoardhouseTS/)
* <u>About</u>: This is an onging project written in TypeScript. It is a game engine for browsers. The project goals are to enable users to quickly develop prototypes, which makes it a perfect game engine to use for weekend game dev competitions such as Ludum Dare, Global Game Jam, and Game Makers Tool Kit. The engine features a React-like UI layer, an Entity Component System, State management for handling scenes, and uses Three.js as the rendering layer. Currently I am in the process of using Cordova to enable exporting projects into native iOS and Android code.

* Global Game Jam submission: [https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/occupational-hazards-5](https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/occupational-hazards-5)
* Source code: [https://github.com/apples/ggj2020](https://github.com/apples/ggj2020)
* Tech used: TypeScript, Webpack, Babel, Node, Three.js
* <u>About</u>: This was a game written in my game engine, BoardhouseTS, by three developers (see below) for the 2020 Global Game Jam. I was not part of the team that wrote any of the game code, I only provided the engine code. Very little communication was needed from me for them to consume the APIs exposed by my game engine. The game got 4th place at the Houston, TX branch of GGJ.

* Source code: [https://github.com/MagentaReds/project-3-srw-multiplayer](https://github.com/MagentaReds/project-3-srw-multiplayer)
* Tech used: jQuery, jQuery UI, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Socket.io, Embeddedjs, Passport, Bootstrap 
* <u>About</u>: This app was built for my final project at the UT Coding Bootcamp with 2 other cohorts. It is a multiplayer tactical role-playing game based off of the Bandai series Super Robot Wars. I was in charge of building the gameplay UI on the front-end and intergrating socket.io so that the various clients playing would remained synced. Since games of this genre are typically designed to be single player games, I assisted our group's game engine developer with much of the game design to ensure that gameplay was fair.

* Source code: [https://github.com/jjwall/LD45](https://github.com/jjwall/LD45)
* Tech used: TypeScript, Webpack, Babel, Node, Three.js
* <u>About</u>: The project was also developed using my game engine, BoardhouseTS, for Ludum Dare 45. I was the sole developer of the game code and also created all the art and sound assets used in the game. My inspiration was to try and create a simpler version of StarCraft. My learning goals were to understand how to currently implement MouseEvents into my engine.

* Tech used: TypeScript, Webpack, Node, Three.js
* <u>About</u>: This was the first project where I pulled in additional developers to build a game using my game engine, BoardhouseTS. It was also the first time I got a chance to compete in a Global Game Jam. I worked on the code for the asteroids and creating the visual assets.
